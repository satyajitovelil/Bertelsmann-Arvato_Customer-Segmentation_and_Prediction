### Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to uncover the relationship between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population of Germany. This will enable the identification of which parts of the population are more likely to be customers of the mail-order company and which are less so. 
The next step involves building a prediction model using demographic information from individuals that were part of a mail-order marketing campiagn to decide whether or not they would succesfully convert into customers. 
By the end of the project, we aim to provide insights that will help the mail-order company better target its campaigns and increase its customer base.
